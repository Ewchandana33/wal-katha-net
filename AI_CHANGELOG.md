# AI Change Log

Add a dated entry for each AI-assisted code, SEO, automation, or deployment
change. Record the reason, affected files, and checks actually completed.
Treat GitHub checks and Cloudflare deployment logs as the source of truth for
release status; never infer a successful production deploy from a commit or
preview. Do not put credentials or tokens in this file.

## 2026-10-14 — Complete PR #15 image-variant CI verification

### Why

PR #15 adds build-time 16:9, 4:3, and square WebP cover variants for public,
indexable story pages. Its original GitHub CI run failed during Astro type
checking because TypeScript 6 could not reach the declarations shipped by
`sharp` 0.35.0 through that package's `exports` map. The Cloudflare preview for
the same commit built and deployed successfully, including the generated
variants; production was still on the preceding `main` commit.

### Changes

- Added a TypeScript path mapping to Sharp's shipped declaration file so the
  build-time image route is type-checked instead of implicitly typed.
- Updated `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` from v4 to Node.js
  24-compatible v5 in response to the deprecation warning in the CI run.
- Created this file because `AI_CHANGELOG.md` did not previously exist on
  `main`.

### Verification trail

- Reproduced the original Sharp declaration error with `yarn run check`.
- After the path mapping, the generated Astro type definitions plus the image
  route produced zero targeted TypeScript diagnostics.
- `yarn test`: 5 tests passed, 0 failed.
- The pre-fix Cloudflare preview deployment for PR #15 completed successfully
  (`8b6e8cde-cfbe-4dc3-9346-7529ff9c181a`); production at the time was
  `a2312ecb3f522cb9530572a465c76c4890979065`.
- Final release status must be verified against the latest PR checks and
  Cloudflare production deployment logs after this change.

## 2026-10-14 — Remove Astro Markdown and Vite build warnings

### Why

The current production build for `main` (`054fa3cce6010760e5f1ae39b2d3fbf7b0aad614`,
Cloudflare deployment `b0d4332d-35c6-41f7-89f3-e6ae150f6925`) completed
successfully, but its Cloudflare build log still reported an unmet Vite peer
dependency for `@tailwindcss/vite` and Astro's deprecation warning for
`markdown.remarkPlugins`. A dependency-tree check also found that the installed
MDX integration declared an older Sätteri peer range than Astro 7.3.8 provides.
These are version/configuration mismatches, so the fix is to align the
dependencies and processor API rather than hide their warnings.

### Changes

- Updated `@astrojs/mdx` to the Astro 7-compatible 8.x line and explicitly
  declared the matching Sätteri and unified Markdown processor packages.
- Declared Vite directly so the Tailwind Vite plugin can resolve its peer.
- Moved `remarkAutoInternalLinks` into `unified()` via Astro's
  `markdown.processor`, preserving the internal-link plugin while removing use
  of the deprecated Markdown configuration field.
- Regenerated `yarn.lock` incrementally from the existing lockfile and replaced
  Replit-local proxy URLs with the public Yarn registry while preserving each
  package's resolved tarball hash, so CI can fetch the new dependencies.
- Left SEO/geo metadata unchanged: the live pages already emit Sinhala
  `hreflang`, `si_LK` locale, canonical URLs, and indexable page metadata; no
  unsupported geographic meta tags were added.

### Verification trail

- `yarn install --non-interactive`: completed and saved the updated lockfile.
- `yarn check`: completed successfully with no dependency errors. It still
  reports 20 existing resolution/deduplication warnings, including the
  repository's pinned `undici` and `js-yaml` resolutions.
- `yarn test`: 5 passed, 0 failed.
- `yarn build`: completed; 50 static pages built, sitemap indexability passed
  for all 30 checked page URLs, featured links passed (3), social metadata
  passed (8 pages), and critical CSS was inlined for 51/51 pages.
- Local `yarn run check` generated Astro types but timed out while waiting for
  diagnostics; this is not counted as a pass.
- GitHub PR #23's `Type-check and production build` and `Cloudflare Pages`
  checks passed for initial commit `6fbc4ede818283820132eef2ef39ebb010f00f8e`.
- Cloudflare preview deployment
  `3c0abfba-80f8-4caf-a273-4f7984306259` completed build and deploy
  successfully. Its logs contain neither the prior Vite peer warning nor the
  Astro Markdown deprecation warning; sitemap, featured-link, social metadata,
  and critical-CSS build gates passed.
- The preview URL returned HTTP 200 and retained `lang="si"`, the canonical
  `https://www.walakatha.net/`, two `hreflang` links, and `og:locale=si_LK`.
- This changelog-only follow-up changes the PR head, so the required GitHub and
  Cloudflare preview checks must be rerun on the final head before merge.
- The production deployment recorded above is the pre-change baseline; this PR
  has not changed production at the time of this entry.
